  Deno Slack Hub
  <br>
</h1>

<h4 align="center">You want to use other peoples code to do your work?</h4>

We definitely do! The hub enables its users to use
[Slack Connectors](https://api.slack.com/automation/connectors) in TypeScript,
offloading the cost of code maintenance and OAuth management to other
developers. Interact with APIs from `Google`, `Salesforce`, `GitHub`, `Giphy`
and more with a minimal amount of code and offload your credential management to
Slack.

## Requirements

- A recent version of
  [`deno`](https://deno.com/manual/getting_started/installation).
- The Slack CLI ([install steps](https://api.slack.com/automation/cli/install))

### Using connectors as a step in a coded workflow

Using connectors as a step in a coded workflow

```ts
import { DefineWorkflow, Schema } from "deno-slack-sdk/mod.ts";
import { Connectors } from "deno-slack-hub/mod.ts";

const GifWorkflow = DefineWorkflow({
  callback_id: "post_random_gif",
  title: "Workflow to post a random gif in a channel",
  description: "A workflow that post a random gif in the channel it is invoked",
  input_parameters: {
    properties: {
      channel_id: {
        type: Schema.slack.types.channel_id,
      },
    },
    required: ["channel_id"],
  },
});

const getRandomGifStep = GifWorkflow.addStep(
  Connectors.Giphy.functions.GetRandomGif,
  {
    rating: "g",
  },
);

GifWorkflow.addStep(Schema.slack.functions.SendMessage, {
  channel_id: GifWorkflow.inputs.channel_id,
  message: getRandomGifStep.outputs.gif_title_url,
});

export default GifWorkflow;
```
